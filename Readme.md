# Iterators

The iterators library is a container independent library for handling enumerations over data.
This is highly inspired by typically Functional Style List handling.

It provides a set of functions for modifying streams of data that can be iterated through.
These streams can also be infinite, through lazy evaluation, each element is only loaded when required, meaning an iterator can also produce an infinite stream of elements, which might only be considered for the first few elements.

Amongst others those functions are:
* Map: Applies a function to each element, creating a stream of the return values of that function
* Filter: Filters the elements with a custom predicate, creating a stream of elements where the predicate returned true
* Take, TakeWhile: Returns the stream of the first elements, either a fixed number, or until a condition is false
* Skip, SkipWhile skips the first elements of a stream, either a fixed number or until a condition is false
* Cast, CastObject: Map using typecasts, either explicit casts `TNewType(value)` or Object Casts: `obj as TNewClass`
* FilterClass: Filter for different c1lasses `obj is TSubClass`
* Index: Creates a stream where for each incoming element a Pair is returned which contains the index (starting with 0 for the first element) and the element itself
* Step: Skips elements in steps, i.e. Step(Iterator, 2) will only give every other element from Interator
* Fold/Reduce: Applies a function to each of the values and the result of the previous step to compute a final result over the whole stream (e.g. a sum over all elements). Not possible on infinite streams.
* Reverse: Reverses a stream from last element to first. First requires loading all elements into memory before repeating them in opposite order. Not possible on infinite streams
* Sorted: Returns all elements sorted according to a less or compare function. Collects all elements to sort, not possible on infinite streams
* Next: Get the next element from an Iterator
* Last: Get the last element from an Iterator, not possible on infinite streams
* Collect, CollectArray: Collects all the elements from the stream into a container (e.g. List, Array, TStringList, etc)

Additionally this package also contains a tuple unit as sub library see [the README](src\tuple\Readme.md) for further information

## IIterator\<T>
The core of this library forms the `IIterator<T>` COM interface.
Any class that implements this interface can be used with the functions described above.

Iterators also implement the required functions to be used in a For-In loop, so you can also iterate through iterators.
```pascal
var
  iter: IIterator<Integer>;
  i: Integer;
begin
  iter := Iterate<Integer>(arr); // create iterator
  iter := filter(isEven, iter); // filter out odd elements
  for i in iter do
    WriteLn(i);
```
As this is a COM interface, it is reference counted, so no manual memory management is required.
This allows easy chaining of iterators:
```pascal
var
  Data: Array of Byte;
  HexStr: String;
begin
  // Converts each of the bytes to the HEX representation and forms a string by concatinating all of them
  HexStr := Reduce<String>(ConcatStr,
            Map<Byte, String>(ByteToHex,
            Iterate<Byte>(arr)));
end;
```

The functions are written in a way that (except default arguments) the last argument will be the iterator, this allows easy reading of the chaining my reading the chain right to left.
Also it allows, as in the example above, to use newlines to make reading the flow easier (bottom to top).

## Generating from Container
To create Iterators for different Container types, does not require rewriting the container to fit this library. All it requires is the implementation of the Iterate function.

The library already provides in the `iterators.base` unit a class to Implement an Iterator based on already existing enumerators. As an example see this implementation to make TStringList compatible:
```pascal
function Iterate(const AStrings: TStrings): specialize IIterator<String>;
begin
  Result := specialize TClassEnumeratorIterator<String, TStringsEnumerator>.Create(AStrings.GetEnumerator);
end;
```
The `TClassEnumeratorIterator` can simply take an existing Enumerator class, `TStringsEnumerator` in this case, and wrap it into an IIterator.
This simple one-liner allows using TStringLists as part of this library:
```pascal
  // Iterate through StringList but in lower case
  for item in Map<String, String>(Iterate(MyStringList), LowerCase) do
    WriteLn(item);
```

This allows adding new Containers to this library without having to change anything about their implementation, with a simple 1 line function.

The Library already provides Iterate functions for the old Pointer style `TList`, pretty much all `Generics.Collections`, arrays and `TStrings`

## Collectors
To collect the streams, e.g. to create a new List, requires to implement a collect function.
The library already provides a collect function for general containers, assuming they have a .Add function:
```pascal
var
  lst: TList<Integer>; // Generics.Collections
begin
  // external creation (safer):
  lst := TList<Integer>.Create;
  try
    Collect<Integer, TList<Integer>>(lst, iter);
    ...
  finally
    lst.Free;
  end;
  // Create by collect (memory leaks if exceptions are raised)
  lst := Collect<Integer, TList<Integer>>(iter);
  try
    ...
  finally
    lst.Free;
  end;
  // Combination of the two custom constructors:
  lst := Collect<Integer, TList<Integer>>(TList<Integer>.Create(), iter);
  try
    ...
  finally
    lst.Free;
  end;
end;
```
Also it allows collecting into arrays:
```pascal
var
  arr: Array of Integer;
begin
  arr := CollectArray<Integer>(iterator)
```
It can be tweaked with the option boolean argument, to either grow the array geometrically (growing by doubling in size), or linear (growing for each element individually). Geometric growth is usually recommended (the same growth behavior as implemented by TList) as it results usually in a much better performance.

## Parallelization
Theoretically iterators could be used to split tasks amongst multiple threads (See Java parallel streams).
Currently this is not supported by this library, but is a use case that will be considered for the future.

## Generators
To ease development of new iterators, the library also provides the ability to create iterators from generating functions, so called generators:
```pascal
procedure IterateFibbonacci;
var
  l1, l2: Integer;

function Fib: Integer;
begin
  Result := l1 + l2;
  l1 := l2;
  l2 := Result;
end;

var
  i: Integer;
begin
  for i in GenerateInf<Integer>(Fib) do
    WriteLn(i);
end;
```

This creates an infinite iterator which will in every iteration call the passed function `Fib` to generate the next value.
You can also create a finite generator by passing a function that returns a `TNullable<T>` which is null if the iteration is done:
```pascal
function ReadLnGenerator: TNullable<String>;
var
  s: String;
begin
  Result := TNullable<String>.Empty;
  if EOF then
    Exit;
  ReadLn(s);
  Result := s;
end;

// Usage
  for ln in Generate<String>(ReadLnGenerator) do
    WriteLn(ln);
```
This generator will check if STDIN is closed, if not it will read the next user input.

## Combination for practical use cases
Each of the provided functions alone are useful but the real practical use-cases emerge from combining these functions.
This allows to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller problems that are solvable with these atomic functions.

One practical example would be, in text analysis it might be useful to collect information about the frequency of certain words or characters.
This library allows easiely to build such functionality with just combining a few of the functions provided here.

Take this example:
```pascal
  m := TDict.Create;
  try
    for p in Take<TDictPair>(5,
             Sorted<TDictPair>(Greater,
             Iterate<Char, Integer>(
             FoldR<TDict, Char>(CountMap, m,
             Iterate<Char>(TFileStream.Create(filename, fmOpenRead)))))) do
      WriteLn('  ''', p.Key,''': ', p.Value);
  finally
    m.Free;
  end;
```
This code creates a generator which reads a file char by char.
Using a fold a dictionary is created to count the occurances of each character.
Lastly this dictionary is sorted and the 5 most common characters are printed to the screen.

The full example with all the required helper functions can be found in [the examples](examples/iteratortest/iteratortest.lpr)

## Notes
### Implicit Specialization
A new feature of FPC is implicit specialization for generic functions. This allows leaving out the generic typing for the functions.
An example can be found in `examples/iterator_test/iteratortest_implicit.lpr`.

This feature can be enabled with the modeswitch `{$ModeSwitch ImplicitFunctionSpecialization}` and allows leaving out the specialization syntax:
```pascal
HexStr := Reduce<String>(ConcatStr,
          Map<Byte, String>(ByteToHex,
          Iterate<Byte>(arr)));
// becomes
HexStr := Reduce(ConcatStr,
          Map(ByteToHex,
          Iterate(arr)));
```
Implicit specialization still has some issues, e.g. still does not work correctly with function pointers, but an example on how much the code can be reduced can be found in the [examples](examples/iteratortest/iteratortest_implicit.lpr)

To ease readability, I would also suggest using `{$Mode Delphi}` rather than objFPC, as it does not require the `specialize` keyword:
```pascal
// Mode Delphi:
HexStr := Reduce<String>(ConcatStr,
          Map<Byte, String>(ByteToHex,
          Iterate<Byte>(arr)));
// Mode ObjFPC:
HexStr := specialize Reduce<String>(@ConcatStr,
          specialize Map<Byte, String>(@ByteToHex,
          specialize Iterate<Byte>(arr)));
```

### Efficiency
Iterators do not provide the most efficient way to iterate through data. The creation of an iterator to iterate an array creates some overhead which could be avoided by clever coding.
This library is designed to trade optimisation for comfort. For the very most cases it should be fast enough, but sometimes it might introduce additional overhead.

Some operations, like reversing or sorting introduce a rather large overhead as all the data is collected and stored temporarily in the iterators.
E.g.
```pascal
  arr := CollectArray<String>(
         Sorted<String>(CompareStr,
         Iterate<String>(arr)));
```
Will be less efficient than an in-place sorting algorithm like quick or heapsort on the same array.

Other operations like converting a TList to an array:
```pascal
  arr := CollectArray<Integer>(Iterate<Integer>(list));
```
Will only introduce a slight overhead, while being much more concise than manual array creation:
```pascal
  SetLength(arr, list.Count);
  for i := 0 to list.Count - 1 do
    arr[i] := list[i]
```
